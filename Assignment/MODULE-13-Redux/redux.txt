1)what is Redux ?
ans:Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.

2)What is Redux Thunk used for?
Ans: Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.

3) what is Pure Component? When to Use Pure Component Over Component?

Ans:Regular Component: Re-renders whenever its parent component re-renders or when its state or props change, even if the changes don't affect the component's output. PureComponent: Implements a shallow comparison in shouldComponentUpdate and only re-renders when there are changes in its state or props.


4) What is the second Argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is purpose?
Ans:The second parameter to setState() is an optional callback function that will be executed once setState is completed and the component is re-rendered. Generally we recommend using componentDidUpdate() for such logic instead
